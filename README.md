# Bird-Feeder
Automatic Bird Feeder
The goal was to create an automatic feeder that house various components connected into a PCB that is a size of a gift card.
I design this to be electrically efficient as possible lasting days on a charge.

This project help me bridge together my love for electronics and touch with wildlife
