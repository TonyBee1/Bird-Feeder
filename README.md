# Bird-Feeder
Automatic Bird Feeder
The goal was to create an automatic feeder that houses various components connected into a PCB no larger than a gift card.
I designed this to be as electrically efficient as possible, lasting days on a charge.
Researching various components and learning how to design circuits allowed me to translate my ideas.
This project helped me bridge my love for electronics and my connection with wildlife.
